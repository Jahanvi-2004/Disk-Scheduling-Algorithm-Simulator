# Disk-Scheduling-Algorithm-Simulator
A Disk Scheduling Algorithm Simulator is a program that mimics how disk I/O requests are handled by different scheduling algorithms. It takes a list of disk cylinder requests and the initial head position, then applies various algorithms like:

FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)

SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)

SCAN (Elevator)

C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)

LOOK

CLOOK (Circular LOOK)

The simulator calculates and displays the seek sequence and total head movements for each algorithm, helping users understand and compare their performance in terms of efficiency and head movement.
